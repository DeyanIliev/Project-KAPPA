In this game you follow the steps of young crusader under the command of Tancred de Hauteville, italo-norman lord, whose maternal grandfather was the famous warrior and conqueror Robert Guiscard.

Choose for what you will fight: faith and salvation, the riches of the East, loyalty to your lord and family or pure desire for adventures.
Ingratiate yourself with the great leaders of the Crusade or make enemies with them, but beware – enmity with such powerful lords could cost you much, but their friendship may make you one of the great barons of Outremer.

Follow your liege Tancred in his adventures in Byzantium, Asia Minor and the Holy Land.
Or try to make your own mark and become one of more successful leaders, carving your own realm from the ashes of this holy war.
Become defender of the Holy Church, great ally to the Emperor of the greeks and even paragon of knightly virtue, second only to Godfroy.
Choose if you’ll marry for love or will you pursue marriage for the sake of advancement of your social status.

Play the game and decide – how famous and respected your hero will be. What will your name be remembered for: glorious warrior, astute diplomat, sadistic powermonger or awe-inspiring adventurer.
